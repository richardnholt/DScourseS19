\section{Data Source Interests}
I would be interested in scraping data off of different news websites in order to analyze word connotations and other potential biases in articles. I would cross-reference these articles either by author or by corporate source to see where these biases lie.

I would also be interested in scraping data from websites which track economic movements and make predictions about economic trends. I would take that web data from the past several years to see which sources track those movements most accurately.


\section{Question 5}
5d.
mydf is a list; mydf student is a data.frame.

\section{Question 6}
6.4 class(df1) is a dataframe. class(df) is a SparkDataFrame.

6.5 After trying to run the select function on df1, there was an error message related to the inability to find the inherited method 'select'.

6.6 This same error occurred for the filter method. No inherited method was found. I believe this happens because R inherits the method from Spark, and the df1 is a normal dataframe, not a SparkDataFrame.
